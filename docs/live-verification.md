# Live two-instance verification checklist

Run the pair, then verify each channel. "Logs" items I can confirm from the agent/plugin
logs; "Screen" items only you can see. NEEDS-LIVE items are the offsets/values that were
reasoned but not observed — a wrong one fails safe (no effect or mis-placed text, never a
crash), so confirming them is the point of this pass.

## Bring it up

```powershell
# 1. stop the orphaned agents from the previous run (they target dead games)
Get-Process KotorCoop.Agent -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# 2. rebuild the Agent with the current code (its bin was locked until step 1)
dotnet build .\src\KotorCoop.Agent\KotorCoop.Agent.csproj -c Debug

# 3. launch both games, load saves, connect the agents (unattended)
pwsh tools\demo.ps1               # -Save N for a different slot; -Stop to tear down
```

Logs land in `%TEMP%\kotorcoop-demo\agent1.log` / `agent2.log` and
`<gamedir>\kotorcoop-plugin.log`.

## Connectivity & phantoms (Logs + Screen)
- agent1.log/agent2.log: `session ... connected`, `peers 1`, non-zero `rx`/`tx`.
- plugin log: `agent reports 1 remote peer(s)`, `1 phantom(s) alive`.
- Screen: each game shows a phantom of the other player that moves as they move.

## In-game ~ console (NEEDS-LIVE: capture timing, native console at menu)
- Press `~`. A console should open (EnableCheats was set in swkotor.ini on first launch).
- Type `say hello` + Enter.
- plugin log: `console: routed a co-op command`.
- Screen: the other player sees `Lanik: hello` (or `Malak:`). Confirms buffer-capture timing.
- Also try `status`, `disconnect`, `reconnect` — agent log echoes each.

## Chat overlay (NEEDS-LIVE: anchor coordinates, font alpha)
- After a `say`, the message appears bottom-left, semi-transparent, and fades after ~9 s.
- If it's off-screen → adjust `chat_overlay_anchor` / calibrate the coords in ChatOverlayController.
- If it's fully opaque → the font texture-env is GL_REPLACE (alpha no-op); note it.

## Doors & placeables (Logs + Screen)
- Open a door / a chest / disarm a trapped container on ONE side.
- plugin log (other side): `door 0x..: swinging`, `placeable 0x..: unlocked/opened`,
  `placeable 0x..: trap disarmed`.
- Screen: the same chest reads opened/unlocked on the other instance.
- NEEDS-LIVE: confirms placeable offsets locked +0x260 / open +0x338 / trap +0x278.

## Shared progression (NEEDS-LIVE: XP stats pointer)
- On the host, pick up credits or gain XP (a kill).
- Screen (client): gold matches the host; XP/level tracks the host.
- If gold syncs but XP doesn't, the stats pointer (creature+0x0A74) needs adjusting — gold
  is on a verified offset, XP goes through that pointer.

## Party, journal, pause, world flags (Screen)
- Companions stay one synchronised set; a quest advanced on one side appears on the other;
  either player's pause pauses both; an opened door/killed boss replicates.

## Dialogue token (Logs + Screen)
- Start a conversation on one side. dashboard/agent shows `dialogue: <who> in a conversation`.
- The other side sees the token owner. (Spectate text + control are task #25, not in this build.)

## Map, name plates (Screen)
- Press M: the peer shows as a pin. The phantom's selection band shows the peer's name.

When done: `pwsh tools\demo.ps1 -Stop`. Report anything that didn't fire and I'll fix the
offset/coord; everything here degrades safe, so a miss is a tuning note, not a crash.
